This directory contains code used for running experiments that were part of a
paper submission. The experiments measure the running time and the clustering
quality of the parallel index-based SCAN algorithm.

Instructions:
* Run `bash download_graphs.bash` to download all the graphs used in the
  experiments.

TODO: update with what scripts to run
TODO: confirm that new `run_gbbs_experiments.cc` results match with measured
results
