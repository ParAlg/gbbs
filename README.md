# GBBS: Graph Based Benchmark Suite  ![Bazel build](https://github.com/paralg/gbbs/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Organization
--------

This repository contains code for our SPAA paper "Theoretically Efficient
Parallel Graph Algorithms Can Be Fast and Scalable" (SPAA'18). It includes
implementations of the following parallel graph algorithms:

**Connectivity Problems**
* Low-Diameter Decomposition
* Connectivity
* Spanning Forest
* Biconnectivity
* Minimum Spanning Tree
* Strongly Connected Components

**Covering Problems**
* Coloring
* Maximal Matching
* Maximal Independent Set
* Approximate Set Cover

**Eigenvector Problems**
* PageRank

**Substructure Problems**
* Triangle Counting
* Approximate Densest Subgraph
* k-Core (coreness)

**Shortest Path Problems**
* Unweighted SSSP (Breadth-First Search)
* General Weight SSSP (Bellman-Ford)
* Integer Weight SSSP (Weighted Breadth-First Search)
* Single-Source Betweenness Centrality
* Single-Source Widest Path
* k-Spanner

The code for these applications is located in the `benchmark` directory. The
implementations are based on the Ligra/Ligra+/Julienne graph processing
frameworks. The framework code is located in the `src` directory.

The codes used here are still in development, and we plan to add more
applications/benchmarks. We currently include the following extra codes,
which are part of ongoing work.

Compilation
--------

Compiler:
* g++ &gt;= 7.4.0 with support for Cilk Plus
* g++ &gt;= 7.4.0 with pthread support (Homemade Scheduler)

Build system:
* [Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html) 2.1.0
* Make --- though our primary build system is Bazel, we also maintain Makefiles
  for those who wish to run benchmarks without installing Bazel.

The default compilation uses a lightweight scheduler developed at CMU (Homemade)
for parallelism, which results in comparable performance to Cilk Plus. The
half-lengths for certain functions such as histogramming are lower using
Homemade, which results in better performance for codes like KCore.

The benchmark supports both uncompressed and compressed graphs. The uncompressed
format is identical to the uncompressed format in Ligra. The compressed format,
called bytepd_amortized (bytepda) is similar to the parallelByte format used in
Ligra+, with some additional functionality to support efficiently packs,
filters, and other operations over neighbor lists.

To compile codes for graphs with more than 2^32 edges, the `LONG` command-line
parameter should be set. If the graph has more than 2^32 vertices, the
`EDGELONG` command-line parameter should be set. Note that the codes have not
been tested with more than 2^32 vertices, so if any issues arise please contact
[Laxman Dhulipala](mailto:ldhulipa@cs.cmu.edu).

To compile with the Cilk Plus scheduler instead of the Homegrown scheduler, use
the Bazel configuration `--config=cilk`. To compile using OpenMP instead, use
the Bazel configuration `--config=openmp`. To compile serially instead, use the
Bazel configuration `--config=serial`. (For the Makefiles, instead set the
environment variables `CILK`, `OPENMP`, or `SERIAL` respectively.)

To build:
```sh
# For Bazel:
$ bazel build  //...  # compiles all benchmarks

# For Make:
# First set the appropriate environment variables, e.g., first run
# `export CILK=1` to compile with Cilk Plus.
# After that, build using `make`.
$ cd benchmarks/BFS/NonDeterministicBFS  # go to a benchmark
$ make
```
Note that the default compilation mode in bazel is to build optimized binaries
(stripped of debug symbols). You can compile debug binaries by supplying `-c
dbg` to the bazel build command.

The following commands cleans the directory:
```sh
# For Bazel:
$ bazel clean  # removes all executables

# For Make:
$ make clean  # removes executables for the current directory
```

Running code
-------
The applications take the input graph as input as well as an optional
flag "-s" to indicate a symmetric graph.  Symmetric graphs should be
called with the "-s" flag for better performance. For example:

```sh
# For Bazel:
$ bazel run //benchmarks/BFS/NonDeterministicBFS:BFS_main -- -s -src 10 ~/gbbs/inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100
$ bazel run //benchmarks/IntegralWeightSSSP/JulienneDBS17:wBFS_main -- -s -w -src 15 ~/gbbs/inputs/rMatGraph_WJ_5_100

# For Make:
$ ./BFS -s -src 10 ../../../inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100
$ ./wBFS -s -w -src 15 ../../../inputs/rMatGraph_WJ_5_100
```

Note that the codes that compute single-source shortest paths (or centrality)
take an extra `-src` flag. The benchmark is run four times by default, and can
be changed by passing the `-rounds` flag followed by an integer indicating the
number of runs.

On NUMA machines, adding the command "numactl -i all " when running
the program may improve performance for large graphs. For example:

```sh
$ numactl -i all bazel run [...]
```

Running code on compressed graphs
-----------

We make use of the bytePDA format in our benchmark, which is similar to the
parallelByte format of Ligra+, extended with additional functionality. We have
provided a converter utility which takes as input an uncompressed graph and
outputs a bytePDA graph. The converter can be used as follows:

```sh
# For Bazel:
bazel run //utils:compressor -- -s -o ~/gbbs/inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100.bytepda ~/gbbs/inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100
bazel run //utils:compressor -- -s -w -o ~/gbbs/inputs/rMatGraph_WJ_5_100.bytepda ~/gbbs/inputs/rMatGraph_WJ_5_100

# For Make:
./compressor -s -o ../inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100.bytepda ../inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100
./compressor -s -w -o ../inputs/rMatGraph_WJ_5_100.bytepda ../inputs/rMatGraph_WJ_5_100
```

After an uncompressed graph has been converted to the bytepda format,
applications can be run on it by passing in the usual command-line flags, with
an additional `-c` flag.

```sh
# For Bazel:
$ bazel run //benchmarks/BFS/NonDeterministicBFS:BFS_main -- -s -c -src 10 ~/gbbs/inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100.bytepda

# For Make:
$ ./BFS -s -c -src 10 ../../../inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100.bytepda
$ ./wBFS -s -w -c -src 15 ../../../inputs/rMatGraph_WJ_5_100.bytepda
```

When processing large compressed graphs, using the `-m` command-line flag can
help if the file is already in the page cache, since the compressed graph data
can be mmap'd. Application performance will be affected if the file is not
already in the page-cache. We have found that using `-m` when the compressed
graph is backed by SSD results in a slow first-run, followed by fast subsequent
runs.

Running code on binary-encoded graphs
-----------
We make use of a binary-graph format in our benchmark. The binary representation
stores the representation we use for in-memory processing (compressed sparse row)
directly on disk, which enables applications to avoid string-conversion overheads
associated with the adjacency graph format described below. We have provided a 
converter utility which takes as input an uncompressed graph (e.g., in adjacency
graph format) and outputs this graph in the binary format. The converter can be 
used as follows:

```sh
# For Bazel:
bazel run //utils:compressor -- -s -o ~/gbbs/inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100.binary ~/gbbs/inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100

# For Make:
./compressor -s -o ../inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100.binary ../inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100
```

After an uncompressed graph has been converted to the binary format,
applications can be run on it by passing in the usual command-line flags, with
an additional `-b` flag. Note that the application will always load the binary
file using mmap.

```sh
# For Bazel:
$ bazel run //benchmarks/BFS/NonDeterministicBFS:BFS_main -- -s -b -src 10 ~/gbbs/inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100.binary

# For Make:
$ ./BFS -s -b -src 10 ../../../inputs/rMatGraph_J_5_100.binary
```

Note that application performance will be affected if the file is not already 
in the page-cache. We have found that using `-m` when the binary graph is backed
by SSD or disk results in a slow first-run, followed by fast subsequent runs.


Input Formats
-----------
We support the adjacency graph format used by the [Problem Based Benchmark
suite](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pbbs/benchmarks/graphIO.html)
and [Ligra](https://github.com/jshun/ligra).

The adjacency graph format starts with a sequence of offsets one for each
vertex, followed by a sequence of directed edges ordered by their source vertex.
The offset for a vertex i refers to the location of the start of a contiguous
block of out edges for vertex i in the sequence of edges. The block continues
until the offset of the next vertex, or the end if i is the last vertex. All
vertices and offsets are 0 based and represented in decimal. The specific format
is as follows:

```
AdjacencyGraph
<n>
<m>
<o0>
<o1>
...
<o(n-1)>
<e0>
<e1>
...
<e(m-1)>
```

This file is represented as plain text.

Weighted graphs are represented in the weighted adjacency graph format. The file
should start with the string "WeightedAdjacencyGraph". The m edge weights
should be stored after all of the edge targets in the .adj file.

**Using SNAP graphs**

Graphs from the [SNAP dataset
collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html) are commonly used for
graph algorithm benchmarks. We provide a tool that converts the most common SNAP
graph format to the adjacency graph format that GBBS accepts. Usage example:
```sh
# Download a graph from the SNAP collection.
wget https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Vote.txt.gz
gzip --decompress ${PWD}/wiki-Vote.txt.gz
# Run the SNAP-to-adjacency-graph converter.
# Run with Bazel:
bazel run //utils:snap_converter -- -s -i ${PWD}/wiki-Vote.txt -o <output file>
# Or run with Make:
#   cd utils
#   make snap_converter
#   ./snap_converter -s -i <input file> -o <output file>
```
